I dream of yesterday, a day full of dreams. Perhaps a better time?

Yet, one thought, one focus passed back to those days, find the truth. It was not so.

Such strange selective memory to instill positive images in mayhem. Can't even remember why we fought.

Past the time of our hour, life goes on. Thus the memory serves as a better mirror,
whilst declining to follow --
the truth.
